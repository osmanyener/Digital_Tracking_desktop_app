# Digital_Tracking_desktop_app

--> This is a demo digital tracking system for 'Mekece Işık'olive oil factory. It runs on a local server.

--> I used MSSQL local server

--> I am working on developing web-based and mobile-based application versions of this demo project.

The system has some features:
  --> gives queue number to customers
  --> calculates the process price, efficiency, claim_of_oil for each customer
  --> saves the data to MSSQL local server
  --> reports daily or according to the specified date
  --> prints information_bill for each customer
  --> exports the records of customers as an excel file
